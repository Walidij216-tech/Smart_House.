# Smart House Project

## Overview

This project implements a smart house system using a Raspberry Pi 3. It includes facial recognition for secure access and monitoring temperature and humidity levels within the house.

### Features

- **Facial Recognition**: Uses OpenCV to recognize faces from a set of pre-trained images.
- **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: Uses a digital sensor to measure and log environmental data.
- **Node-RED Visualization**: Provides real-time temperature monitoring using a Node-RED dashboard.

## Components

1. **Facial Recognition**: Implemented in Python using OpenCV.
2. **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: Implemented in Node.js.
3. **Node-RED Visualization**: Displays temperature data in a real-time dashboard.
